# heart-disease-predicton
This project aims to predict the risk of heart disease using machine learning techniques. It analyzes various health parameters such as age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and lifestyle factors to determine the likelihood of heart disease. 
Overview
Cardiovascular diseases are among the leading causes of mortality worldwide. Early detection and risk assessment can significantly improve patient outcomes. This project leverages machine learning algorithms to analyze patient data and predict heart disease risks, assisting healthcare professionals and individuals in making informed decisions.
